# nhl_player_classification

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and CSV file of NHL player statistics (basic and advanced) from the 2016-17 season.  The notebook presents a workflow to read in these stats and perform an unsupervised learning analysis.  The goal of the analysis is to uncover clustering in stats space which would support the notion that players can be broadly grouped into a handful of categories (e.g. sniper, playmaker, power forward, and so on; see https://www.easports.com/nhl/eashl/news/2015/eashl-player-classes).  To aid in this search, two additional files are included which list tentative assignments of players (made by me) to two particular categories.  These lists are used in the workflow to identify stats of interest for clustering.

The analysis proceeds through various stages (with visualizations mixed in).  First, we begin with some basic preparations of the data, including transformations of data types, completions of missing features, and creations of new features.  The created features largely focus on normalizing season totals by the time on ice played, which would presumably elevate the rank of players who were more productive (offensively) with their ice time.  To reduce the impact of noise, we purge from the sample those players with less than 20 games played and who play defense.
